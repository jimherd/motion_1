FPGA code for motion control board for updated HW undergraduate robot.

Uses Altera MAX10 device

# WattBot Motion control board

Robot motion control board uses an Altera MAX 10 device to provide low level features for 4 motors

* encoder pulse counting from A/B/I encoders
* velocity measurement
* Independent PWM generation in range 1Khz to 500kHz
* Standard RC servo control channels
* On-board ARM M4 controller to provide higher level features
